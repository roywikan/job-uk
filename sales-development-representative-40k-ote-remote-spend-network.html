            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>About Us At Open Opportunities, we have a simple but ambitious goal: to collect every public tender and contract in the world and make it available to everyone. We have harnessed the power of data and AI to create a central hub where government suppliers can seamlessly explore and engage with public sector opportunities on a global scale. Simply put, Open Opportunities is “the contracting search
engine”. We’re growing rapidly. The environment here is lean and agile, we prioritise fast growth with an exciting environment to match. Successful applicants will join as early employees, with significant opportunities to impact our primary business activities. This is a chance to join at an exciting period of growth with lots of opportunities and new leads to go after with a proven strategy, leaving plenty of room for many years to come to keep hitting your numbers and make plenty of commission. What’s not to love as a sales person? The Opportunity The SDR is responsible for collaborating with the wider sales and marketing team to meet "top of funnel" targets. You will:• Generate qualified opportunities at the top of the funnel through a multi-channel approach that includes phone calls, emails, and Linked In.• Research prospects and qualify leads and opportunities to ensure a high-quality sales pipeline and demos for the head of sales (complete demos once trained)• Work closely with our marketing team to nurture and convert leads and provide feedback on campaigns to optimise our lead generation process.• Write detailed reports for booked opportunities.• Represent Open Opportunities and our clients professionally in all communications.• Thoroughly qualify leads through strategic questioning and active listening, allowing you to uncover their potential pain points and gaps in their current workflow.• Take ownership of your prospecting pipeline and ensure strong CRM hygiene accurately logging all prospect engagements. What you bring• Resilience, unafraid of a challenge. In sales, you’re going to hear the word “no” a lot. We need people that can push through the no’s to find the clients that will truly benefit from our solution. An unstoppable mentality is needed.• Strong communication skills. Whether you’re talking to our clients or collaborating within our team, this will be vital. Strong active listening skills to assess prospects' needs effectively are also a must.• Analytical mindset. Being able to constantly analyse your work processes, how to become more efficient and how to be better at every aspect of what you do here will help drive success.• Willingness to constantly learn. Never getting comfortable with ‘knowing enough’ is a massive bonus, if you’re the sort of person who understands you can always improve and be better, it’ll pay off hugely in this role.• Desire to build a long-term career. This role is a stepping stone within Open Opportunities. We are looking for people that are eager to learn and improve and make a key contribution to the continued success of the business.• Ability to work well independently and as a team. We’re a growing, close-knit team that is rapidly growing. We all need to get along but handle not having a constant direction. You need to be able to work at pace consistently throughout the day to ensure success.• Previous Sales experience is a must with experience in the full sales cycle (ideally Saa S), from cold calling, email and Linkedin Prospecting to running demos and closing deals. Ideally have experience in understanding how companies sell into the public sector and the procurement process. A proficiency with CRM systems (Zoho knowledge is a plus)• Proven track record of consistently opening qualified opportunities that lead to revenue. What’s In It For You• We are a very small company and work 100% remotely but you are welcome to work in a shared office if that suits you.• Market specific training and a full, proven strategy to help you succeed in the role will be provided.• You will have a pension, 25 days paid annual leave. We would expect this individual to grow their role and in time develop a sales team and function. Salary: £21,500 - £25,000 (dependent on experience), plus uncapped commission. £40,000 OTE (our targets are made to be hit, £60,000+ is possible in this role). Sadly no agencies at this stage but we have a small list of excellent ones we would utilise if needed.</p>

            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>Hello! Thanks for checking out our job posting for the role of Senior Manager, Supply Chain at PerchPeek. You’ve already taken a tiny step towards being a part of our team – huzzah! We know that taking your next career step is as exciting as it can be exhausting. So, with that in mind, we’ve tried to keep our description simple and cliché-free to help you decide if PerchPeek and this role are a
good match for you. Who and What is PerchPeek? At PerchPeek we dream of a borderless world where people have the freedom to live and work where they please. Where ideas and resources flow where they’re most needed unrestricted by national borders. We strive to create a world of opportunity for everyone, anywhere – one move at a time. We’re building a streamlined Mobility ecosystem to empower businesses and individuals to move anywhere in the world. We support employers and employees through every stage of the relocation process, providing an affordable, scalable, high-value service, powered by technology and relocation expertise. Have you ever relocated? If so, you probably know how overwhelming it can be—immigration hoops, tax implications, housing, shipping, utilities, banking…the list goes on. No matter where in the world you go, relocating is complicated, time-intensive, and stressful. PerchPeek was conceived to change that. For relocators, our goal is to guide them through every step of their move with a delightful mix of tech, coaching, content, and partnerships which work together to make relocating simpler, faster, and more fun. For employers, we streamline the entire process into one easy-to-use platform, turning Mobility into a strategic advantage for thriving globally. Now you know why we’re so passionate about what we do! The RoleThe primary aim of this role is to build and nurture a worldwide network of service delivery partners, while optimizing PerchPeek’s operations to deliver exceptional relocations for our customers. As the Senior Supply Chain Manager, you will own the complete partnership lifecycle – from identifying and onboarding new partners, to maintaining strong relationships and driving revenue growth. ResponsibilitiesWhilst every role in a startup has a degree of flexibility over time, here is what we see as the role’s main responsibilities:<BR>- Manage and grow our global network of partners across key service lines. Own the entire end-to-end partnerships cycle, from researching (both customer needs and provider/partners), pipeline development, proactive initial outreach, proposals, negotiation, process establishment, to then finally actively maintaining the partnership database and relationships.<BR>- Drive consistent adoption amongst the Relocation Experience team by building strong processes to onboard and embed partners, including training both partners and our internal teams.<BR>- Increase Relocator satisfaction by driving operational excellence in our partner network, regularly reporting on performance & pipeline.<BR>- Drive revenue through our partner network - lead on negotiations, chase referral payments, structure proposals<BR>- Internal collaboration. Develop and deliver processes to, and alongside, Relocation Experience, GTM and Finance teams, as well as being involved in technical product integration.<BR>- Ad Hoc requests, particularly with regards to RFPs, pricing support, and dealing with partner-related escalations. RequirementsThe type of person we think will be awesome at this will likely have the following range of qualities and experience:<BR>- Experience in full-cycle partnership development, from initial outreach and relationship building to contract negotiation and ongoing management<BR>- Operational experience of implementing, iterating and monitoring performance of a partnership or supply chain network<BR>- Track record of influencing a variety of internal & external stakeholders<BR>- Experience negotiating commercial deals & driving revenue through partnersBeyond these great attributes, we’re especially interested in candidates with the below skills or qualifications:<BR>- Experience working autonomously or in a small team<BR>- Previous responsibilities of database management / system management<BR>- A highly organised, rigorous, and detailed-oriented approach to project management, new process development and continuous improvement<BR>- Experience working towards a revenue or commercial target in a previous role<BR>- An interest in how PerchPeek’s supply chain integrates into the overall product experienceAn additional area to note: We are a remote first Company and so predominantly you’ll be able to work wherever you’d like. However, you should expect to travel internationally 3-4 times per year for this role, whether that’s for internal events, client meetings, or to connect with a partner. Pay & BenefitsSalaryTotal compensation packages are based on a wide array of factors unique to each candidate, including but not limited to demonstrated skill set, years and depth of relevant experience, location and some role-dependent factors. We’ll be happy to discuss this during the interview process. The PerchPerks<BR>- Company share options - be a business owner and have your very own little piece of PerchPeek.<BR>- Flexible Holiday and Leave - you’ll receive all statutory holiday plus wellbeing leave and flexible annual leave for you to rest, relax, or recharge as you see fit.<BR>- Work from Anywhere - PerchPeek is a fully distributed company that supports employees in working wherever they’d like to be within the parameters of your role’s requirements. We offer an allowance to ensure your working environment suits you.<BR>- Learning & Development Budget - so you can be proactive about learning something fun outside of your core role.<BR>- Regular socials, an annual offsite, and a meetups budget - or time spent turning colleagues into friends (corny but we don’t care). Ready to be a Perchy? Firstly, no need for a full cover letter (phew!) Please just share your resume and answer our small number of get-to-know-you questions. If we think we’re well matched, you’ll be invited to a virtual interview with one of the PerchPeek team so we can get to know each other a bit better. Afterwards, if we think we might be well matched, we’ll be doing a series of interviews with different members of our teams & a case study. All interviews will take place via video call. We hope you’re as excited to apply as we are to hear from you - good luck! Note: Studies show that women and people of colour are less likely to apply for jobs unless they believe they meet every single one of the qualifications as described in a job description. We are an Equal Opportunity employer committed to a diverse and representative team. Whatever your gender, race, religion, age, sexual orientation, marital status or disability - we want to hear from you! We would strongly encourage you to apply, even if you don't believe you meet every one of the qualifications described.</p>
